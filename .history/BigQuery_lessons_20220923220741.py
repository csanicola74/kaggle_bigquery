##  Getting Started With SQL and BigQuery  ##

from google.cloud import bigquery

# Your first BigQuery commands
# To use BigQuery, we'll import the Python package below:

# The first step in the workflow is to create a Client object. As you'll soon see, this Client object will play a central role in retrieving information from BigQuery datasets.

# Create a "Client" object
client = bigquery.Client()

# Using Kaggle's public dataset BigQuery integration.

"""
We'll work with a dataset of posts on Hacker News, a website focusing on computer science and cybersecurity news.

In BigQuery, each dataset is contained in a corresponding project. In this case, our hacker_news dataset is contained in the bigquery-public-data project. To access the dataset,

We begin by constructing a reference to the dataset with the dataset() method.
Next, we use the get_dataset() method, along with the reference we just constructed, to fetch the dataset.
"""

# Construct a reference to the "hacker_news" dataset
dataset_ref = client.dataset("hacker_news", project="bigquery-public-data")

# API request - fetch the dataset
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)

"""
Every dataset is just a collection of tables. You can think of a dataset as a spreadsheet file containing multiple tables, all composed of rows and columns.

We use the list_tables() method to list the tables in the dataset.
"""

# List all the tables in the "hacker_news" dataset
tables = list(client.list_tables(dataset))

# Print names of all tables in the dataset (there are four!)
for table in tables:
    print(table.table_id)

# Similar to how we fetched a dataset, we can fetch a table. In the code cell below, we fetch the full table in the hacker_news dataset.

# Construct a reference to the "full" table
table_ref = dataset_ref.table("full")

# API request - fetch the table
table = client.get_table(table_ref)

####################
##  Table schema  ##
####################

# The structure of a table is called its schema. We need to understand a table's schema to effectively pull out the data we want.

# In this example, we'll investigate the full table that we fetched above.

# Print information on all the columns in the "full" table in the "hacker_news" dataset
table.schema

"""
Each SchemaField tells us about a specific column (which we also refer to as a field). In order, the information is :

* The name of the column
* The field type ( or datatype) in the column
* The mode of the column('NULLABLE' means that a column allows NULL values, and is the default)
* A description of the data in that column
"""

# The first field has the SchemaField:

SchemaField('by', 'string', 'NULLABLE',
            "The username of the item's author.", ())

"""
This tells us:

* the field ( or column) is called by,
* the data in this field is strings,
* NULL values are allowed, and
* it contains the usernames corresponding to each item's author.

We can use the list_rows() method to check just the first five lines of of the full table to make sure this is right. (Sometimes databases have outdated descriptions, so it's good to check.) This returns a BigQuery RowIterator object that can quickly be converted to a pandas DataFrame with the to_dataframe() method.
"""

# Preview the first five lines of the "full" table
client.list_rows(table, max_results=5).to_dataframe()

# The list_rows() method will also let us look at just the information in a specific column. If we want to see the first five entries in the by column, for example, we can do that!

# Preview the first five entries in the "by" column of the "full" table
client.list_rows(
    table, selected_fields=table.schema[:1], max_results=5).to_dataframe()
